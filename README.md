# Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to reconstruct dream visuals by classifying EEG (Electroencephalogram) brainwave data using Machine Learning techniques. The idea is to map brain activity recorded during sleep to corresponding visual patterns or dream categories.

# Key Objectives:
1. Collect and preprocess EEG data from publicly available datasets like OpenBCI or Neurotycho.

2. Extract features from raw EEG signals (e.g., using time-frequency analysis like FFT, wavelet transforms).

3. Train classifiers (like CNNs, RNNs, or classical ML models) to recognize different types of dream imagery based on brainwave patterns.

4. Reconstruct dream content or predict dream classes based on classified EEG signals.
